                <h4>“Tomboy”: Embracing Individuality</h4>
                <p>
                    Released in 2022, “Tomboy” is a bold anthem that celebrates individuality and challenges traditional gender norms. The song presents a powerful narrative where the members assert their identity, rejecting societal expectations of femininity.

                    Lyrically, “Tomboy” is a declaration of self-acceptance. The members confidently proclaim their preferences and attitudes, embracing a more masculine identity while simultaneously celebrating their femininity. Lines that challenge the stereotypes associated with women serve as an empowering message, encouraging listeners to define their identity on their own terms.
                    
                    The accompanying music video further amplifies this theme, featuring dynamic choreography and striking visuals that convey strength and confidence. The use of a punk-inspired aesthetic, complete with edgy fashion choices, reinforces the song's message of defiance against societal norms. By presenting themselves in a way that subverts traditional expectations, (G)I-DLE inspires their fans to embrace their true selves without fear of judgment.

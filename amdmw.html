                <h3>“Tomboy”: Embracing Individuality</h3>
                <p>
                    Released in 2022, “Tomboy” is a bold anthem that celebrates individuality and challenges traditional gender norms. The song presents a powerful narrative where the members assert their identity, rejecting societal expectations of femininity.

Lines that challenge the stereotypes associated with women serve as an empowering message, encouraging listeners to define their identity on their own terms.
